// TOPiC: Shared Pointer

//NOTES:
//0. shared_ptr is a Class template, is a smart pointer can share ownership of object (managed object).
//1. Several shared ptr can point to the same object (managed object).
//2. it keep a reference count to maintein and how many shared ptr are pointing to the same object.
//   and once last shared_ptr goes out of scope then the managed object gets deelted.
//3. shared_ptr is "threads safe" and not thread sabe, whas is this?
//   a. Control block is thread safe
//   b. managed object not.
//4. There are three ways shared_ptr will distroy managed object.
//   a. if the last shared_ptr goes out of scope
//   b. if you initialize shared_ptr with some other shared_ptr
//   c. if you reset the shared_ptr
//5. Reference cout doesn´t work when we use reference or pointer of shared_ptr
